# Hi There

I’m Chao Zhang, currently I live in Vancouver working as a Software Developer. My daily projects include web and mobile dev. Most of the time, I focus on Front End Development.

I established [Coding Fun Education](https://www.codingfun.dev) in 2019 Sep to provide students with online coding education. It lets students quickly learn the fundamental of different programming languages in a fun way.

Please contact me if you are interested in Coding Fun Education so we can work together to make it better.

In my spare time, I love making some fun projects, teaching students coding and playing video games.
